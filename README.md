# Automate /now

My attempts at automating my [/now page](https://akashgoswami.com/now).

Inspired by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/blog/automating-my-now-page/) and [Sophie Koonin](https://localghost.dev/blog/everything-should-have-an-api-adventures-in-trying-to-automate-stuff/). 

## Data sources
Getting data from various services isn't easy. A lot of services and platforms do not offer a viable way of retrieving your data. 

Instead I've found a number of other services that allow me to obtain and track this data.

### üçø [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)
Letterboxd provides an RSS feed for each of its users. 

**Adding movies to the RSS feed**

To add movies to your Letterboxd RSS feed, you need to click the 'Review or log' button for a movie and add a date for when you watched the movie.

**Viewing the RSS feed**

Via the Letterboxd website, log in and then view your profile. 
There is an RSS icon at the end of the profile navigation menu. Clicking this will take you to the profile's RSS feed.

The RSS url is formatted in the following format:

`https://letterboxd.com/USERNAME_HERE/rss/`

Simply replace the USERNAME_HERE part with any Letterboxd username to view their RSS feed.

### üìö [Oku](https://oku.club)
Oku provides [an RSS feed for each collection](https://oku.club/blog/oku-has-rss-feeds) for a user. By default users of Oku will have three collections; To Read, Reading and Read.

Finding this feed url isn't super straight forward as there's no icon for it in the web app. Intead to get this url, you'll need to right click the page and select 'Inspect' (or View Page Source) and then under the body tag you should see a line like this:

`<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="https://oku.club/rss/collection/UNIQUE_STRING_HERE">`

The url listed here is the RSS feed for your collection - Most folks will want to use the default 'Reading' collection for this script.

### üì∫ [Serializd](https://www.serializd.com/)
Serializd does **not** provide an RSS feed for users but is it possible to retrieve data in a JSON format using their API.

For this script I've used the Diary API endpoint (`https://www.serializd.com/api/user/USERNAME_HERE/diary`) to retrieve recently watched TV shows that have been logged.

To add an episode to your diary, click the 'Log/Review' button for the episode and add a date for when you watched the episode.
